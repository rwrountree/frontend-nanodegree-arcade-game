## Overview
Welcome to Rice Rocks for the web!

This project is an adaptation of a project that I did for Coursera's
An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 2)
 
It's an asteroids(ish) clone. Yes, another Asteroids clone! Behold! :D

## Quickstart
* Left: Turn Left
* Right: Turn Right
* Up: Thrust
* Spacebar: Shoot

## Game Things
* The ship's shield can take 100 points of damage.
* It takes one missile to destroy any size asteroid.
* Large Asteroid: 100 points, damages for 6 points
* Medium Asteroid: 200 points, damages for 4 points
* Small Asteroid: 300 points, damages for 2 points

## Tips
* There is no limit on how fast you can fire (not responsible for the spacebar on your keyboard :D)
* The ship can go relatively fast, but I wouldn't recommend going full speed.
* Asteroids come out of the corners. Avoid the corners.
