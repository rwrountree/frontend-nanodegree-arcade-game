{"name":"Frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game","tagline":"Asteroids clone using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas","body":"## Overview\r\nWelcome to Rice Rocks for the web!\r\n\r\nThis project is an adaptation of a project that I did for Coursera's\r\nAn Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 2)\r\n \r\nIt's an asteroids(ish) clone. Yes, another Asteroids clone! Behold! :D\r\n\r\n## Quickstart\r\nOpen index.html from the dist folder. That is the optimized version of the game.\r\n\r\n## Game Things\r\n* Left: Turn Left\r\n* Right: Turn Right\r\n* Up: Thrust\r\n* Spacebar: Shoot\r\n\r\n* The ship's shield can take 100 points of damage.\r\n* It takes one missile to destroy any size asteroid.\r\n\r\n* Large Asteroid: 100 points, damages for 6 points\r\n* Medium Asteroid: 200 points, damages for 4 points\r\n* Small Asteroid: 300 points, damages for 2 points\r\n\r\n## Tips\r\n* There is no limit on how fast you can fire (not responsible for the spacebar on your keyboard :D)\r\n* The ship can go relatively fast, but I wouldn't recommend going full speed.\r\n* Asteroids come out of the corners. Avoid the corners.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n* Art assets created by Kim Lathrop\r\n* Audio assets by Sound Dogs\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
